When running the Tingle App the first view the user sees is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tingle-view-portrait}. In this view the user can add new things and their whereabouts to the database, search for exists things and finally list all things in the database. Clicking the button \texttt{List of all things} will open up the List Activity shown in Figure \ref{fig:list-view-portrait}. The list view is a scrollable list showing all items in the database. Tapping an item in the list will toggle the \emph{What} (i.e the name of the item) and \emph{Where} (the location of the item). The user can also delete an item by Long pressing on an item. A popup dialog appears as seen in Figure \ref{fig:delete-verification-dialog}.

Changing the orientation to landscape then the two views are show side-by-side. The same functionality applies to this view as they do in portrait mode as described above. The only difference is the removal of the \texttt{List of all things} button since the list is already visible to the right.

\section{Testing}

\section{Issues}

Code duplication using the Activities.

I could make a common file with the side-by-side fragment layout and programatically test
if we are in landscape orientation.
